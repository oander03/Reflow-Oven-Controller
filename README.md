## Hardware Overview
* Microcontroller: DE10-Lite/DE1-SoC 8052 soft processor
* Amplifier: OP07PC
* Capacitors: 2 10uF
* K-type Thermocouple
* Keypad
* Resistor 330 Ohms
* Speaker CEM-1302
* Diode 1N4148
* N-channel MOSFET FQU13N06LS
* DC-to-DC Voltage Converter TCP7660
* Two buttons


## Specifications
* Selectable reflow profile parameters such as soak temperature, soak time, reflow
temperature, and reflow time using pushbuttons or switches and displayed on the LCD
* Display of temperature(s), running time, and reflow process current state on an
LCD
* Selectable large display of oven temperature with 7-
segment displays available on the DE10-Lite boards

* Start/Immediate Stop pushbutton.
  
* Temperature strip chart plot in degrees Celsius using the serial port attached to the processor and a
personal computer

* Sound feedback using speaker. Five beeps when the reflow process is
completed. Ten beeps when there is an error.

## Extra functionality 

# Microwave mode
- has a timer

- custom music note characters
- allows you to make song
# Two songs you can pick
- 2 fully done songs that will play at the end when its done
- can chose between them  
# Python cool graph
- shows prediction graph by taking in the parameters
- dynamically resizes based on current temp
- changes colour the hotter it is
  
# Discord messaging
- When the cook cycle elapses, members of the community will be notified on discord, so you can monitor your it from wherever you are

## LCD
- State 0: Paramters on the 7 segments, temperature of oven and time on the LCD
- State 1-5: oven temperature on the 7segs, and 2 screens on LCD: one parameters, one oven temperature/total time on first row, second row is progress bar and state running time and state number
